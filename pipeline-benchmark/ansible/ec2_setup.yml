# Setup an Ec2 instance + Mounted EBS volumes for benchmarking
# It should have the following software dependencies:
# - git
# - rust
# - rust nightly
# - cargo-flamegraph
# - linux-perf
# We should check that the host has the following devices mounted:
# - <input_device> # The device to use for benchmark input
# - <packed_device> # The device to use for the packed inputs
# - <unpacked_device> # The device to use for the unpacked inputs
# We check that those devices are mounted at the following paths:
# - <input_mount> # The directory where benchmark input exists on its device
# - <packed_mount> # The directory where the packed inputs exist on its device
# - <unpacked_mount> # The directory where the unpacked inputs exist on its device
# We check that each path has enough space for the benchmarking
# - <input_mount>.available_space >= total_input_size_gb
# - <packed_mount>.available_space >= input_size_gb
# - <unpacked_mount>.available_space >= input_size_gb
# Arguments:
# -e input_device=/dev/sdb # The device to use for the test set
# -e input_mount=/home/input # The directory where the test set exists on its device
# -e packed_device=/dev/sdc # The device to use for the packed test set
# -e packed_mount=/home/packed # The directory where the packed test set exists on its device
# -e unpacked_device=/dev/sdd # The device to use for the unpacked test set
# -e unpacked_mount=/home/unpacked # The directory where the unpacked test set exists on its device
# -e input_size_gb=100 # The size of the test set in GB
# -e total_input_size_gb=1000 # The total size of the test set in GB
