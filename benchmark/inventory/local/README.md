# Local 
You can always orchestrate benchmarks on your local machine, and use it to develop and test the benchmark process.

## Provisioning the instance
Turn your computer on lol

## Setting up the instance
We don't provide local setup scripts, but so long as:
- Your configured paths can hold enough data
- You have the dependencies installed:
  - git
  - rust (nightly)
  - time (for `time` command)
You should be good to go!

### Destroying the instance 
sledgehammer it

done! :tada:
